    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Garlic bread is bread that's been spread with garlic and butter, and then baked or grilled until toasted. It's often made with a French baguette, but can also be made with sourdough or ciabatta. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Bread</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Butter or olive oil</li>
            <li>Herbs like oregano or chives</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep your pan & bread. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or tinfoil, slice your bread in half lengthwise, and place the bread cut side up on the baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Make the garlic butter. In a small bowl mix the herbs and salt together with the softened butter. Spread it evenly over the top of the bread halves.</li>
            <li>Bake & serve. Bake the bread for 10-15 minutes at 425 degrees F until it’s slightly golden brown on the edges. If you’re adding cheese, add it in the last 2 minutes of baking. Then cool, slice into 1-inch pieces, and devour!</li>
        </ol>
